[btc-e exchange hacked](http://bitcoinmagazine.net/btc-e-attacked/)

BTC-E [says](https://btc-e.com/news/81):

> Our Liberty Reserve API Secret Key was compromised.

> Using the key the hacker imitated LR deposits from many accounts and bought up Bitcoins, Namecoins and Litecoins.

> We lost our daily volume, approx. 4500 BTC. The attacker couldn't withdraw more
as most BTC were distributed over several offline wallets.

> We will refund all losses from our reserves.
