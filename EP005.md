- U.S. regulators directed five of the country's biggest banks, including Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, to develop plans for staving off collapse if they faced serious problems, emphasizing that the banks could not count on government help.

  > With optional, user-defined transaction privacy, the use of money
  for purposes of identity linking falls by the wayside. True, it
  enables a paper cashless society but not with the attributes that
  the tax-efficient anti-cashists want. Without government checkpoints
  for financial institution wire transfers, bitcoin capital flows
  freely, without limits, and perhaps anonymously. The harmful tools
  of centralized monetary policy would also not exist. And finally,
  the taxation of income that began in the United States in 1913 would
  operate on the honor system — the honor of the taxpayer, that
  is. This could be welcome news for some as a progressive income tax
  was a fundamental tenet of Marxism.

  > In his first post, Fred mentioned “the emergence of currencies that
  are not controlled by nation states in my lifetime.” He clearly
  acknowledges that significant ramifications result from the
  “decoupling of currencies from governments,” but I wonder if he has
  come to terms with what that actually means.

  > Then, a bit of bitcoin drama occurred when Rep. David Schweikert
  (R-Arizona) initially referred to the cryptocurrency as “um….what
  was one of them called?….something….coin” near the end of the
  hearing. To my knowledge, that is only the second time that bitcoin
  has been entered into the congressional record. The first being when
  Prof. Larry White mentioned bitcoin in his prepared testimony for
  the Free Competition in Currency Act of 2011.
